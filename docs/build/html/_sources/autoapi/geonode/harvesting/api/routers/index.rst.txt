   A router that enables PATCH requests on the `list` endpoint.

   This router is designed to provide API endpoints that accept PATCH requests targeting a viewset's `list` endpoint. It is useful for batch updates on multiple resources.

   **Use case example:**
   Consider the scenario of selecting remote resources for harvesting by the local GeoNode:

   1. The user views a (paginated) list of resources available on the remote service.
   2. The user then selects which resources should be harvested.
   3. Instead of requiring multiple PATCH requests for each individual resource's detail page to update the `should_be_harvested` property, the user can make a single PATCH request to `harvesters/{harvester-id}/harvestable-resources` to update the `should_be_harvested` property on multiple resources simultaneously.
