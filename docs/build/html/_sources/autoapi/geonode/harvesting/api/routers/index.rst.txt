   A router that allows performing PATCH requests against the `list` endpoint

   This router is used in order to provide API endpoints that respond to PATCH
   requsts against a viewset's `list` endpoint. It is useful for situations where it
   is necessary to perform a batch update of multiple resources. For a use case,
   consider the selection of which remote resources should be harvestable by the local
   GeoNode:

   - User is shown a (paginated) list of resources that are available on the remote
   service
   - User must now choose which of these harvestable resources should be harvested
   - Instead of forcing the user to make multiple PATCH requests to each harvestable
   resource's detail page in order to set the resource's `should_be_harvested`
   property, user can perform a PATCH request to
   `harvesters/{harvester-id}/harvestable-resources` and set multiple resources'
   `should_be_harvested` at the same time
